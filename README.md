# US-Bikeshare-Data exploration
This is my submitted project in a Udacity nanodegree program, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing 
descriptive statistics,in addition to, script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
