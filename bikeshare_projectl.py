'''
This is my submitted project in a Udacity data analysis nanodegree program, I used Python to explore data 
related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, 
in addition,script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience 
in the terminal to present these statistics.
